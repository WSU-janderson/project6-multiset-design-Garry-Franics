# MultiSet Design
## Introduction

This document details the design of my MultiSet ADT. A MultiSet is a collection of elements in which elements are able
to be repeated. My design is for a video game inventory that stores string item names and unsigned int counts. It will
be built on a AVLTree<string, unsigned int>.

## Design Philosophy

My MultiSet prioritizes simplicity as the main quality of its design. I want this ADT to be easy to implement and modify
if needed. Game inventories have all kinds of different specifications. Some have weight limits or a fixed maximum
number of items, others let you carry as many things as you want with no limitations at all. Because games have all of
these variations, I want my MultiSet to be as simplistic as possible so it can be used as a base for any system.
