# MultiSet Design
## Introduction

This document details the design of my MultiSet ADT. A MultiSet is a collection of elements in which elements are able
to be repeated. My design is for a video game inventory that stores string item names and unsigned int counts. It will
be built on a AVLTree<string, unsigned int>.
